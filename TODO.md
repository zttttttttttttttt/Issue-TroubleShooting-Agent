# TODO

### Feature
- compatible with autogen
- tool execute try catch exception add evaluator, add suggestion (v1) (done need test)
- validation retry in generic planner(v1) (done need test)
- change context by step(v2)
- enrich log (input/output/prompt)(v2)
- knowledge & background rag (v2)
- support overwrite validation max attempt and threshold(v2)
- knowledge graph to collect sufficient information(v2)

### Test
- more unit testing

### Doc
- read me for each example
- how to debug in the library?
- add R2D2 in readme
- add FAQ section

# Completed
- generic model creation and config
- stream processing for each step during the execution
- step validator by category, support customized
- history planning experience for improving
- successful generation rate
- put example in another project
- UI interaction
- pass parent task for all step execution 
- fix background used in planner
- validation add execution history 
- expose generic planner prompt from graph planner 
- change validator to evaluator
- abstract validator base, unique output return
- adjust planner prompt to use tool better
- bug (done)
